# Project 5 - Kanap
implemented individually during training program in Openclassrooms.
> Build an e-commerce Website with JavaScript vanilla (only front-end).

## Features
* A home page showing (dynamically) all items available for sale.
* A “product” page that (dynamically) displays product details on
which the user clicked from the home page. From this page, the user
can select a quantity, a color, and add the product to their basket.
* A “shopping car” page. This contains several parts:
    * A summary of the products in the car 
    * the total price, the possibility to modify the quantity of a selected product 
    * delete a selected product
    * A form for placing an order. The form datas are validated before sending to the backend. 
    For example, no number in a first name field.
* A “confirmation” page including:
    * An order confirmation message thanking the user for his order
    * and indicating the order identifier sent by the API.
